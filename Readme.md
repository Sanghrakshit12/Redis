# Task Queue System with Redis and Node.js

This project implements a task queue system using Redis and Node.js. It consists of two components:

1. **Primary Backend**: This component adds tasks to a Redis queue.
2. **Worker**: This component picks up tasks from the Redis queue and processes them asynchronously.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker (Redis container)
- Node.js (if you want to run the backend code locally)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone 
2. cd Redis
